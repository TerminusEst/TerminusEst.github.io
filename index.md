## About Me
I am a Senior Data Scientist based at SkySpecs in Dublin. Today I am working on wind turbines and green energy! Previously, I was a physicist based at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, USA. There I researched large space weather events and the risk they pose to grounded networks. This involved simulating geomagnetic superstorms (using the [Space Weather Modeling Framework](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005JA011126)), as well as researching historical geomagnetic storm events from the 19th and 20th centuries.  

I am experienced with geophysical modeling, manipulating and visualising large amounts of data, machine learning and scientific computing (mainly Python). I also have experience teaching computing and physics to students of all ages. You can find my [resume](https://terminusest.github.io/assets/Sean_Blake_resume.pdf) and [academic CV](https://TerminusEst.github.io/assets/SEAN_BLAKE_ACADEMIC_CV.pdf) here (not up to date!).

This is my personal page, where you can find my: [Experience](#experience), [Education](#education), [Publications](#publications). Here is an updated [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10lbZhxmjrpPgh9HlyFuT8ApaAkT0JRU7X3iwGNXs6M4/edit?usp=sharing) I give to students about my (previous) job!
